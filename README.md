## Running React on Repl.it

Start by logging into or creating a replit account
Then fork this replit into you own account

We would like you to create a form input with a submit button
that allows a user to type strings and save them to an array.
That array of strings should be rendered to the screen in a list.
each press of the submit button adds another string to the list, and thus, the screen.
Good Luck!

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
